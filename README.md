**COMPUTER AUTOMATION USING HAND GESTURES**

This  is a small project implementing the use of machine learning tools to automate the computer tasks such as cursor movements, clicks, double clicks, scroll, change volume, take screen shots, etc; by recognizing the user's hand gestures. This implemented completely in python using the some libraries such as cvzone, mouse, pyautogui, etc. Currently the computer tasks that can be controlled using geastures inlcude:
1. Cursor movement (with index finger)
2. Left click (with index and middle finger pressed together)
3. Right click (with index and middle finger pressed together, also the ring finger raised so total 3 fingers)
4. Double click (with index and thumb)
5. Scroll up (with index and middle finger pressed together, also the thumb raised)
6. Scroll down (with index and middle finger pressed together, also all fingers raised)
7. Volume up (One hand shows a 'V' with index and middle fingers and the other hand has index raised)
8. Volume down (One hand shows a 'V' with index and middle fingers and the other hand has thumb raised)
9. Screen shot (Both hands must raise thumb and index, also the thumb tips must touch)
10. Video play/pause (One hand makes a fist while the other hand shows the palm, all fingers raised)
11. Video fast forward (One hand makes a fist while the other hand has index raised)
12. Video rewind (One hand makes a fist while the other hand has thumb raised)
